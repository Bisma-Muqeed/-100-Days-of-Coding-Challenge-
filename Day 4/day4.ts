// ðŸš€ Day 4 Challenge: Start Coding! ðŸš€

// Question 10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs youâ€™ve written, and add at least one comment to
// each. If the programs are straightforward at this point, just add your name and the current date at the
// top of each program file. Then, write one sentence describing what the program does.

// Bisma Muqeed, 20-Aug-2024
// This program prints a personal message.

let myName: string = "Bisma Muqeed";
console.log(`Hello ${myName}, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?`);

// Question 11: Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in an array called names. 
// Print each personâ€™s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

let friendsName : string[] = ["Bisma" , "Ayesha" , "Taiyaba" , "Tasbiyah"]
for (let i = 0; i < friendsName.length; i++) {
    console.log(friendsName[i]);
}


// Question 12: Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each personâ€™s name,
// print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their
// name

let friendsNames: string[] = ["Bisma", "Haziq", "Hayam"];
for (let name of friendsNames) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?`);
}
