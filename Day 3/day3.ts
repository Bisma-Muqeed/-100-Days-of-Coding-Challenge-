// Question 7: Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that 
// each result in the number 8. Enclose your operations in print statements.

//Question 8 : You should create four lines that look like this:

// Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line. 

// Question 8 and question 7 solved the same way

// Addition Operation

console.log(4 + 4)

// Subtraction Operation
    
console.log(16 - 8)

// Multiplacation Operation

console.log(2 * 4)

// Division Operation

console.log(16 / 2)

// Question 9: Favorite Number:
// Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, create a message revealing your favorite number. 
// Print that message

let favoriteNumber = 8
let message = " is my favorite number because it's my BirthDay date."
console.log(favoriteNumber + message )
